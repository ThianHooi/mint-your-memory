# Mint Your Memory

## What does this project do?

This is a simple frontend that allows user to upload an image and mint the image as a `ERC-1155` NFT. After contract is deployed, it will also allow user to airdrop the NFT to the other wallet addresses.

The project idea is to allow one to share a memory or image as a NFT to his friends or family. 

## TODO

- [ ] Better page navigation (E.g: add back button that allow user to go back to previous screen)
- [ ] Mobile responsive
- [ ] Dashboard to show deployed NFTs
